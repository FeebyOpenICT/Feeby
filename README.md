# Feeby
Feeby is a tool that allows students to receive feedback in an organised and fast manner from teachers and experts in their field.
## Running the tool locally
### Docker
run `make start` or the equivalent `make` to launch the development environment.

run `make prod-start` to test your code, build and run the production environment locally on your machine.

run `make down` or `make prod-down` to stop the respective environments.

These are the most important commands to know but you should take a look in the makefile to see what all the commands do. 

### Locally
Read the README within the backend and frontend folders to look at how to run this tool without docker.
